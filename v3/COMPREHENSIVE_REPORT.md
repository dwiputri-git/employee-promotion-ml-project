## 1. Dataset Validity, Preprocessing, Engineering, and Documentation

### 1.1 Dataset Validity and Relevance
- **Source:** `data/employee-promotion.csv` (internal HR dataset)
- **Size:** 1,000 rows × 10 columns (original)
- **Relevance:** Features align with HR promotion signals (performance, leadership, tenure, projects, peer review, position level)
- **Documentation:** Schema documented in `data/data-documentation.md`; checksums tracked via Git

### 1.2 Data Preprocessing
**Missing Values:**
- Initial missing: 449 total missing values across columns
- Target (`Promotion_Eligible`): Dropped rows with missing target (61 rows removed)
- Numeric features: Imputed with median
- Categorical (`Current_Position_Level`): Imputed with mode ('Mid')
- **Final clean dataset:** 939 rows after preprocessing

**Duplicates:**
- No duplicate rows detected; duplicate policy implemented (drop exact duplicates)

**Outliers:**
- IQR-based detection: Drop if <5% outliers, else winsorize
- Removed outliers: Age (4 rows), Years_at_Company (2 rows), Training_Hours (4 rows)
- Negative values: Removed 1 row with negative `Years_at_Company`

**Final Clean Dataset:** `v3_data/employee_promotion_clean.csv` (939 rows, 10 columns)

### 1.3 Feature Engineering
**New Features Created:**
- **Binned features:** 
  - `Training_Level` (5 quantiles: Very Low, Low, Moderate, High, Very High)
  - `Leadership_Level` (4 quantiles: Low, Medium, High, Very High)
  - `Project_Level` (4 quantiles: Low, Moderate, High, Very High)
  - `Tenure_Level` (4 quantiles: New, Mid, Senior, Veteran)
  - `Age_Group` (4 quantiles: Young, Early Mid, Late Mid, Senior)
- **Interaction:** `Perf_x_Leader` = Performance_Score × Leadership_Score
- **Log transform:** `Projects_per_Years_log` (log1p) for highly skewed `Projects_per_Years`

**Feature Selection:**
- Dropped: `Employee_ID` (identifier), `Projects_per_Years` (intermediate)
- **Final feature set:** 16 columns (9 original + 7 engineered)

**Justification:**
- Binning captures non-linear relationships and reduces noise
- Interaction terms capture multiplicative effects
- Log transform addresses skewness for better linear model performance

### 1.4 Reproducibility
- Fixed random seeds: `random_state=42` throughout
- Consistent file I/O: `v3_data/` and `v3_artifacts/` directories
- Requirements: `v2/requirements.txt` (shared dependencies)
- All notebooks are executable and documented

---

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 2.1 Statistical Summary
- **Target distribution:** Binary `Promotion_Eligible` 
  - Class imbalance: ~70% class 0 (not eligible), ~30% class 1 (eligible)
  - Moderate imbalance requiring class-weighting or SMOTE

### 2.2 Data Quality Insights
- Missing values prevalent (449 total), indicating data collection gaps
- Outliers minimal (<1% per feature), handled via IQR
- No duplicates detected

### 2.3 Modeling Implications
- Class imbalance → Use PR-AUC as primary metric (more informative than accuracy)
- Mixed numeric/categorical features → Requires preprocessing pipeline
- Potential non-linear relationships → Tree-based models may outperform linear

---

## 3. Feature Selection, Transformations, and Justification

### 3.1 Features Used
- **Predictors:** All columns except `Employee_ID` (9 numeric + 1 categorical)
- **Engineered:** 7 additional features (bins, interactions, log transforms)
- **Total features:** 16

### 3.2 Transformations
- **Numeric:** StandardScaler (standardization)
- **Categorical:** OneHotEncoder (one-hot encoding for `Current_Position_Level`)
- **Pipeline:** `ColumnTransformer` ensures consistent preprocessing

### 3.3 Justification
- One-hot encoding preserves non-ordinal nature of job levels
- StandardScaler stabilizes linear models; tree models are robust to scaling
- Feature engineering captures domain knowledge (training/leadership levels, tenure)

- **Feature Importance:** Model coefficients (Logistic Regression) provide direct interpretability
- **Key Drivers:** Expected to include Performance_Score, Leadership_Score, Years_at_Company

### 9.2 Fairness Analysis
**Slice Metrics by Position Level:**

| Position Level | Precision | Recall |
|----------------|-----------|--------|
| Senior | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| Mid | 0.6 | 0.2 |
| Junior | 0.428 | 0.188 |
| Lead | 0.0 | 0.0 |

**Error Rates by Position Level:**

| Position Level | FP Rate | FN Rate |
|----------------|---------|---------|
| Senior | 0.571 | 0.143 |
| Mid | 0.738 | 0.333 |
| Junior | 0.703 | 0.063 |
| Lead | 0.692 | 0.600 |

**Fairness Findings:**
- **Bias Detected:** Model performs poorly on Senior and Lead positions (precision/recall = 0.0)
- **High FP Rates:** Mid and Junior positions have high false positive rates (>70%)
- **High FN Rate:** Lead position has highest false negative rate (60%) — missing eligible leads

**Recommendations:**
- Investigate data imbalance by position level
- Consider stratified sampling or position-specific models
- Document potential bias in model deployment

## 10. Error Analysis and Business Impact

### 10.1 Error Analysis
**Confusion Matrix Breakdown:**
- **Total Errors:** 105 (91 FP + 14 FN)
- **Error Rate:** 55.6% (105/188 test samples)
- **False Positives:** Dominant error type (91 vs. 14 FN)

**Per-Slice Error Patterns:**
- **Lead:** High FN (60%) — model misses eligible leads
- **Mid/Junior:** High FP (70%+) — over-promotes
- **Senior:** Balanced errors but small sample size

### 10.2 Business Impact

**False Positives (Over-Promotion):**
- **Cost:** Promoting unsuitable candidates leads to:
  - Performance issues in new role
  - Team dissatisfaction
  - Increased turnover
  - Financial cost of promotion packages
- **Impact:** High (91 FP = significant financial/talent risk)

**False Negatives (Missed Opportunities):**
- **Cost:** Missing eligible candidates leads to:
  - Employee dissatisfaction
  - Increased turnover risk
  - Lost talent development
  - Demotivation of high performers
- **Impact:** Moderate (14 FN = manageable but concerning)

**Threshold Policy:**
- Current threshold (0.209) optimized for F1 score
- **Recommendation:** Lower threshold if prioritizing recall (avoid missing eligible), raise if prioritizing precision (avoid false promotions)

### 10.3 Recommendations
